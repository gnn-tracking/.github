# Tracking with Graph Neural Networks

![](profile/assets/banner.jpg)

[Charged particle tracking][tracking-wiki] is one of the cornerstones of modern HEP experiments.
It is also a combinatorically hard problem due to the amount of hits and tracks in every collission event.
Recently, machine learning techniques have been proposed to speed up the traditional tracking algorithms, in particular for applications in high level triggers.
The code in this organization approaches the problem with graph neural networks, in particular employing object condensation techniques.
